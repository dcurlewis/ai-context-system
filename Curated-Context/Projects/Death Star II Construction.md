# Death Star II Construction

Second iteration of the Imperial battle station project, incorporating lessons learned from the destruction of the original Death Star. Currently behind schedule and over budget.

## Current Status
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks behind revised schedule
- **Budget**: 15% over allocation (primarily hull plating from [[Kuat Drive Yards]])
- **Key risk**: [[Thermal Exhaust Port Remediation]] design review pending
- **Blocker**: Superlaser calibration requires [[Dr. Bevel Lemelisk]]'s direct oversight; availability constrained

## Key Decisions
- See [[20260105-Stormtrooper-Training-Vendor-Selection]] for security staffing approach
