## Summary

Productive end to the week. The [[Death Star II Construction]] status review with [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] went better than expected — he accepted the revised timeline without the usual interrogation, which suggests he's getting pressure from above to show progress rather than perfection.

## Key Events

- **Morning**: Reviewed [[Stormtrooper Training Programme]] pilot data with [[General Veers]]. The accuracy numbers are improving but still well below target. Veers is optimistic; I'm less convinced the simulation-only approach will get us to 40%.
- **Afternoon**: [[Admiral Piett]] flagged a supply chain issue with [[Kuat Drive Yards]] — hull plating deliveries slipping again. Need to escalate if it continues next week.
- **End of day**: Quick sync with [[Dr. Bevel Lemelisk]] on the thermal exhaust port redesign. He's confident in the new shielded approach but wants more testing time. Reasonable request.

## Action Items

- [ ] Follow up with [[Kuat Drive Yards]] on hull plating delivery schedule (Monday)
- [ ] Review Veers' proposal for supplementing simulation training with live exercises
- [ ] Schedule [[Moff Jerjerrod]] for construction progress walkthrough next week

## Energy / Morale

Good week overall. Team seems energised after the holidays. The Tarkin meeting going smoothly was a relief — sets a positive tone for Q1.
