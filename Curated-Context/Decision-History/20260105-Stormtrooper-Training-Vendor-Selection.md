# Decision Record — Stormtrooper Training Vendor Selection

**Date**: 2026-01-05
**Type**: Vendor selection decision
**Decision maker**: Darth Vader
**Contributors**: [[Stormtrooper Commander TK-421]], [[General Veers]]
**Status**: Final

---

## Context

Imperial Stormtrooper blaster accuracy sits at 3.7% — a figure that has become an operational liability and, frankly, a source of embarrassment. Multiple engagement reports show Rebel forces sustaining minimal casualties against numerically superior Stormtrooper detachments.

The [[Stormtrooper Training Programme]] was authorised in November 2025 to address this. A vendor selection process was initiated to identify a training and simulation partner capable of delivering measurable accuracy improvement.

## Decision

**Selected vendor: SienarTech**

Contract: 2.4M Imperial credits for a 6-month comprehensive training programme including:
- 12 simulation training pods (delivered to all major training facilities)
- AI-driven targeting analysis and personalised training programmes
- Contractual accuracy improvement guarantee: 15% by end of Q3 2026
- Monthly assessment reports and programme adjustments

## Vendor Evaluation

### SienarTech (Selected)
- **Proposal**: Full simulation-based training suite
- **Strengths**: Only vendor to offer contractual accuracy guarantees. Existing relationship with Imperial military (TIE fighter systems). Proven training methodology used by Imperial pilot corps (where accuracy rates are significantly higher).
- **Weaknesses**: Most expensive option. Long deployment timeline (2 weeks for installation).
- **Evaluation score**: 87/100

### BlasTech Industries
- **Proposal**: Weapons modification (improved sighting systems) + basic marksmanship training
- **Strengths**: Lowest cost (1.1M credits). Fastest deployment (1 week). Addresses equipment as a factor.
- **Weaknesses**: Fundamental limitation — modifying weapons doesn't fix the training gap. No accuracy guarantee. Previous BlasTech training programmes showed <2% improvement.
- **Evaluation score**: 52/100

### Kuat Systems Engineering
- **Proposal**: VR-based immersive training environment
- **Strengths**: Innovative technology. Scalable across the Empire. Lower long-term cost.
- **Weaknesses**: Unproven at military scale. No existing deployments. No accuracy guarantees. 3-month development period before deployment could begin.
- **Evaluation score**: 61/100

## Rationale

SienarTech won on three critical factors:

1. **Guarantees**: The only vendor willing to contractually commit to accuracy improvement targets. If they fail to deliver 15% accuracy by Q3, financial penalties apply.
2. **Proven methodology**: Their pilot training programmes have demonstrated results. Adapting proven methods to infantry is lower-risk than unproven technology.
3. **[[General Veers]]'s endorsement**: Veers evaluated all three proposals from a ground forces perspective and strongly favoured SienarTech's practical approach. His exact words: "I don't need innovation. I need troopers who can hit what they're aiming at."

The cost premium (2.2x BlasTech's proposal) is justified by the operational and reputational cost of the current 3.7% rate. One successful Rebel escape due to poor accuracy costs more in strategic terms than the entire programme budget.

## Implementation Plan

| Milestone | Date | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Contract signed | 2026-01-05 | Complete |
| Training pod delivery | 2026-01-12 | In progress (3 pods arrived damaged, replacements in transit) |
| Installation complete | 2026-01-14 | Pending |
| First cohort begins | 2026-01-15 | On track |
| 30-day assessment | 2026-02-15 | Scheduled |
| 90-day assessment | 2026-04-15 | Scheduled |
| Target accuracy (15%) | 2026-09-30 | Target |

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Trooper resistance to training | Medium | Medium | [[Stormtrooper Commander TK-421]] managing messaging as "elite programme" not remediation |
| Training pod supply issues | Low (3 already damaged) | Medium | Replacement pods in transit; SienarTech contractually liable |
| Accuracy improvement plateau | Medium | High | Monthly assessments allow early pivot; financial penalties if targets missed |
| Budget overrun | Low | Low | Fixed-price contract with defined scope |

## Stakeholder Reactions

- **[[Stormtrooper Commander TK-421]]**: Enthusiastic. Personally invested in programme success. Framing it as "elite training" to avoid morale impact.
- **[[General Veers]]**: Supportive but pragmatic. "Let's see the results before we celebrate."
- **[[Grand Moff Tarkin]]**: Approved budget without objection. Commented: "It's about time."
- **[[Emperor Palpatine]]**: Not directly briefed on vendor selection. Will receive results.
