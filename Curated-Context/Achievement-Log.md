## 2025

### Q4 2025

- **Thermal Exhaust Port Audit**: Initiated station-wide engineering review after intelligence reports flagged potential vulnerability. Overruled initial dismissal from [[Dr. Bevel Lemelisk|Lemelisk]], ensuring the review went ahead. Resulted in 3 remediation proposals now under evaluation.
- **Fleet Resourcing Framework**: Developed resource allocation framework with [[Admiral Piett|Piett]] that balances Death Star II construction demands against operational fleet readiness. Adopted as standard across naval operations.
- **Stormtrooper Training Programme Overhaul**: Drove vendor selection process resulting in [[SienarTech]] contract for marksmanship improvement programme. Baseline accuracy: 3.7%. Target: 15% by Q2 2026.

### Q3 2025

- **Death Star II Construction Oversight**: Took direct oversight of DS-II timeline after [[Moff Jerjerrod|Jerjerrod]] missed two consecutive milestones. Introduced weekly progress reviews and dependency tracking that identified 4 critical path blockers.
- **Hoth Intelligence Operation**: Coordinated cross-functional intelligence gathering that confirmed Rebel base location on Hoth. Personally approved probe droid deployment strategy over objections from junior officers.
- **Cross-functional Alignment**: Facilitated first joint planning session between Naval Operations and Ground Forces, resulting in unified Hoth assault plan with clear command structure.

### Q2 2025

- **Emperor's Strategic Review**: Presented Death Star Operations quarterly review to [[Emperor Palpatine]]. Received endorsement for accelerated DS-II timeline and additional resource allocation.
- **Team Expansion**: Successfully onboarded [[Colonel Yularen]] as Director of Imperial Intelligence, filling critical gap in threat assessment capability.
- **Process Improvement**: Implemented structured 1-on-1 cadence across all direct reports. Early feedback positive; [[Admiral Piett|Piett]] noted it was "the first time someone actually listened" (per 1-on-1 notes, Q2).
