# Dr. Bevel Lemelisk

- Chief Architect and lead of [[Death Star Engineering]]. Designed the original superlaser array and thermal exhaust port.
- Technically brilliant but defensive about past design decisions. Reluctant to acknowledge the exhaust port vulnerability as a fundamental flaw rather than an acceptable trade-off. Responds better to data-driven arguments than authority pressure.
