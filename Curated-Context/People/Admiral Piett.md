# Admiral Piett

- Direct report. Competent fleet commander, consistently delivers despite resource constraints.
- Anxious personality; needs reassurance but performs well under pressure. Recently raised concerns about fleet resourcing being diverted to Death Star II construction (see [[20260103-One-on-One-Admiral-Piett]]).
