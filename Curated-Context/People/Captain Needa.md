# Captain Needa

- Member of [[Imperial Naval Operations]]. Commands the Star Destroyer Avenger and handles fleet logistics coordination.
- Well-meaning and diligent, but overly apologetic when things go wrong. Takes failure personally. Needs encouragement to escalate issues early rather than trying to fix everything alone.
