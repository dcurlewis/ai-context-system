## Summary

Two channels active today with notable content. #fleet-operations had a productive discussion about Outer Rim patrol logistics and an incident report from [[Captain Needa]]. #death-star-engineering was quieter but included a passive-aggressive exchange between [[Moff Jerjerrod]]'s team and fleet logistics about crew allocation.

## Channel: #fleet-operations

### Outer Rim Patrol Update
- **[[Admiral Piett]]**: Posted the revised patrol schedule for the expanded Hoth sector coverage. Well-structured, clear rotation plan. Response from fleet captains was positive.
- **[[Captain Needa]]**: Reported losing contact with a probe droid signal in the Anoat sector. Signal was intermittent and likely a sensor glitch, but Needa filed a full incident report and volunteered to personally review the sensor logs. His message: "I take full responsibility for the lost signal and will ensure our detection protocols are reviewed."
- **[[General Veers]]**: Responded to Needa with a grounding note: "Captain, a sensor glitch is a sensor glitch. Let's not convene a tribunal over it." This is Veers at his best — defusing disproportionate responses with dry humour.

### Ground Force Readiness
- **[[General Veers]]**: Posted a brief ground force status update. All battalions at readiness. Training exercises proceeding on schedule. Cold-weather gear requisition approved for potential Hoth operation. No issues. Classic Veers — delivered the update, didn't dramatise it, moved on.

## Channel: #death-star-engineering

### Crew Allocation Friction
- **Engineering Officer (Jerjerrod's team)**: Posted a request for the transferred construction crews' schedule, tagging fleet logistics. Tone was clipped: "We need the crew allocation confirmed by end of day. Construction doesn't pause for fleet scheduling."
- **Fleet Logistics Officer**: Responded that crew transfer paperwork was in process and would be complete by 2026-01-08. Tone was professional but cool.
- **No escalation** — but the exchange reflects the underlying [[Admiral Piett]] / [[Moff Jerjerrod]] tension filtering down to their teams. Worth monitoring.

### Kyber Crystal Supply Update
- **Engineering procurement officer**: Brief update that the next kyber crystal shipment from Jedha is confirmed for 2026-01-12. Quantity: 60% of the requested allocation. No explanation for the shortfall.
- **Notable**: Only 60% of requested supply. This likely means the superlaser array timeline extends further. [[Moff Jerjerrod]] has not commented publicly on this.

## Decisions Made

None formally. The crew allocation timeline was informally agreed (2026-01-08).

## Action Items

- [ ] Monitor kyber crystal supply shortfall — 60% delivery likely impacts DS-II timeline further
- [ ] Check in with [[Captain Needa]] — incident report disproportionate to the issue, consistent with his pattern

## Dynamics & Tone

- **#fleet-operations**: Healthy, professional channel. Piett's leadership style creates a culture of clear communication. Veers's presence adds a grounding, no-nonsense element.
- **#death-star-engineering**: Tense. The crew allocation exchange shows Jerjerrod's team absorbing his stress. The clipped tone from engineering was notable — they're feeling squeezed.

## Relevance to Current Work

- The kyber crystal shortfall (60% delivery) is a new data point on [[Death Star II Construction]]. Jerjerrod hasn't surfaced this in his status reports yet — a flag.
- [[Captain Needa]]'s over-reaction pattern continues. Consistent with memory observations.
- Piett-Jerjerrod tension is manifesting at the team level through their officers. Still manageable, but could escalate if resource competition intensifies.
