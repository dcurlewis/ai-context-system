# One-on-One — Admiral Piett

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Type**: 1:1 meeting
**Attendees**: Darth Vader, [[Admiral Piett]]
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Location**: Death Star I, Vader's briefing chamber

## Summary

Productive 1:1 with [[Admiral Piett]]. He opened up about fleet resourcing concerns following the engineering review decision to reallocate construction crews. Discussed his development as a leader, fleet readiness targets, and the Rebel pursuit intelligence. Piett is growing in confidence but still defaults to anxiety under pressure. Overall a positive interaction — he left with clarity on priorities and reassurance about fleet operations.

## Discussion Points

### Fleet Resource Impact
Piett came prepared with numbers — a good sign. His analysis showed fleet readiness dropping from 87% to 82% with the crew reallocation, and potentially to 78% if the 6-week assignment extends. He presented three scenarios:

1. **Accept 82% readiness** — manageable if no major engagements required
2. **Compress maintenance schedule** — risky, could lead to system failures
3. **Recall one reserve destroyer from Outer Rim patrol** — maintains 85% readiness but reduces patrol coverage

Vader approved option 3 as a contingency if readiness drops below 80%. Piett was visibly relieved.

### Rebel Pursuit Status
Piett briefed on the Outer Rim patrol expansion. Probe droids have returned interesting data from the Hoth system — energy readings consistent with a hidden installation. He's cautiously optimistic but unwilling to commit to a "confirmed" assessment yet. Good analytical discipline.

He's coordinating with [[Colonel Yularen]] on intelligence validation. Expects a preliminary assessment within 2 weeks.

### Personal Development
Asked Piett directly how he felt about speaking up in the engineering review. He was surprised by the question, then admitted he "almost didn't" raise the fleet concern. His instinct was to accept the decision silently and work around it.

Encouraged him to continue voicing operational concerns. Explicitly stated: "I need you to tell me when decisions have costs I haven't considered. That's not disagreement — it's doing your job."

He nodded but it'll take repetition for this to stick. His default mode is compliance, not counsel.

### Workload & Morale
Piett mentioned his senior officers are stretched — the expanded patrol zone means longer rotations. He's managing it but flagged it as unsustainable beyond 3 months. His executive officer, Commander Gherant, is handling the scheduling well but needs relief rotation planning.

Fleet crew morale is "adequate" — Piett's words, which from him means it's fine. He doesn't inflate.

## Decisions

| Decision | Context | Decided By |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Contingency: recall 1 reserve destroyer if readiness drops below 80% | Fleet readiness insurance during DS-II crew reallocation | Darth Vader |

## Action Items

- [ ] [[Admiral Piett]] — Submit revised fleet readiness plan with contingency options — Due: 2026-01-05
- [ ] [[Admiral Piett]] — Provide Hoth system preliminary intelligence assessment — Due: 2026-01-17
- [ ] Darth Vader — Follow up on Piett's workload concern in next 1:1 — Due: 2026-01-17

## Dynamics & Observations

### Trust Building
This was one of the more open conversations with Piett. He shared concerns he wouldn't raise in a group setting — workload, sustainability of the patrol tempo, his own hesitation about speaking up. This level of candour is exactly what makes 1:1s valuable. The relationship is deepening from "direct report executes orders" to "trusted subordinate provides counsel."

### The Anxiety Pattern
Piett's nervous energy is channelled productively — he over-prepares rather than under-delivers. But the underlying anxiety about making mistakes or disappointing leadership limits his strategic thinking. He's so focused on not failing that he sometimes misses opportunities to propose bold moves.

The next development challenge: move him from "reliably executes" to "proactively proposes."

### What Piett Didn't Say
He didn't mention the tension between himself and [[Moff Jerjerrod]] over resources, though it's clearly on his mind. This suggests either he's managing it privately (good) or avoiding it (less good). Worth probing in the next 1:1.

## Performance Notes

**Vader's effectiveness**: Good. Created space for Piett to be honest. The direct encouragement about speaking up was well-timed. Providing a concrete contingency (recall reserve destroyer) gave Piett actionable assurance rather than just words.
