# Death Star II — Quarterly Engineering Review

**Date**: 2026-01-01
**Type**: Project review
**Attendees**: [[Grand Moff Tarkin]], [[Moff Jerjerrod]], [[Admiral Piett]], [[Dr. Bevel Lemelisk]], Darth Vader
**Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Location**: Death Star I, Command Conference Room

## Summary

Quarterly engineering review of [[Death Star II Construction]]. [[Moff Jerjerrod]] presented a status update showing the project 3 weeks behind the Emperor's timeline. The superlaser focusing array is stalled on kyber crystal supply chain issues. [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] pressed hard on accountability. [[Admiral Piett]] raised fleet maintenance concerns about resource reallocation. Decision made to reassign 2 Star Destroyer construction crews to DS-II. [[Dr. Bevel Lemelisk]] gave a defensive update on the thermal exhaust port redesign.

The meeting was tense. Jerjerrod is clearly struggling under pressure, and Tarkin's questioning bordered on adversarial. Piett showed growth by speaking up about fleet impact despite visible nervousness.

## Discussion Points

### Death Star II Construction Status
[[Moff Jerjerrod]] opened with the status report. Key figures:
- Northern hemisphere structural framework: 85% complete
- Superlaser focusing array: stalled (kyber crystal dependency)
- Secondary systems: 60% complete
- Overall: 3 weeks behind the Emperor's timeline

Jerjerrod attributed the delay primarily to the kyber crystal supply chain — Jedha mining operations have underdelivered for the second consecutive quarter. When pressed by [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] on whether this was foreseeable, Jerjerrod deflected to procurement: "The supply forecasts we were given were inaccurate."

**Vader's assessment**: The supply chain issue is real, but Jerjerrod's planning should have included contingency. He's managing upward rather than solving the problem.

### Resource Reallocation
Jerjerrod requested additional construction crews. After discussion, agreed to reassign 2 Star Destroyer construction crews to DS-II for a 6-week period.

[[Admiral Piett]] raised concerns about fleet maintenance impact: "If we divert those crews, three Star Destroyers will remain in extended maintenance. Fleet readiness drops to 82%."

This was a notable moment — Piett doesn't usually push back in large meetings. He was nervous but made a legitimate operational point. Tarkin acknowledged it; Vader overruled based on DS-II priority but noted the trade-off.

### Thermal Exhaust Port Redesign
[[Dr. Bevel Lemelisk]] presented the security review update for the DS-II thermal exhaust port design. The new design uses a shielded approach with no direct external pathway. Lemelisk was defensive throughout — any question about design choices was met with lengthy technical justifications. He's clearly still sensitive about the original Death Star vulnerability.

The redesign looks sound technically. Lemelisk needs to be managed diplomatically — his expertise is irreplaceable, but his defensiveness can slow decision-making.

## Decisions

| Decision | Context | Decided By | Impact |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| Reassign 2 construction crews to DS-II | 3-week delay on DS-II timeline | Darth Vader, ratified by [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] | Fleet maintenance cycle extends 2 weeks; 3 Star Destroyers delayed |
| Continue 3-stage quality testing on reactor shielding | [[Moff Jerjerrod]] wanted to cut testing to save time | Darth Vader (prior decision upheld) | Timeline remains as-is; no shortcuts on safety |

## Action Items

- [ ] [[Moff Jerjerrod]] — Provide daily (not weekly) progress updates on superlaser array until kyber crystal supply resumes — Due: 2026-01-03
- [ ] [[Admiral Piett]] — Revise fleet readiness plan accounting for extended maintenance cycle — Due: 2026-01-05
- [ ] [[Dr. Bevel Lemelisk]] — Complete independent security audit of exhaust port redesign — Due: 2026-01-15
- [ ] Darth Vader — Schedule site visit to DS-II construction to independently assess progress — Due: 2026-01-10

## Dynamics & Observations

### Tarkin's Pressure Campaign
[[Grand Moff Tarkin]] was deliberately adversarial with [[Moff Jerjerrod]]. His questions weren't seeking information — they were establishing a record of Jerjerrod's accountability. "So you're telling me procurement is to blame, not planning?" This is Tarkin positioning himself. If DS-II fails, he wants the record to show he identified the problems early.

### Piett's Growth Moment
[[Admiral Piett]] speaking up about fleet impact was significant. Six months ago, he would have silently accepted the resource reallocation. Today he raised a legitimate concern, backed it with data (82% fleet readiness), and held his position when challenged. He deferred when Vader made the final call, but the objection is on record. This is development worth encouraging.

### Jerjerrod's Crumbling Confidence
[[Moff Jerjerrod]] is visibly deteriorating under pressure. His body language was closed — arms crossed, minimal eye contact with Tarkin. His explanations are becoming more elaborate, which usually means the underlying facts are getting worse. The request for daily updates is partly about information and partly about forcing transparency.

### Lemelisk's Sensitivity
[[Dr. Bevel Lemelisk]] remains brilliant but fragile on the topic of the original Death Star. The thermal exhaust port redesign is genuinely improved, but every discussion about it reopens old wounds. Need to find a way to validate his work on DS-II without constantly invoking the failure of DS-I.

## Performance Notes

**Vader's effectiveness**: Strong. Controlled the room, made a clear decision on resource reallocation, and balanced the competing priorities well. The upheld decision on quality testing sent the right signal — no shortcuts.

**Missed opportunity**: Could have used the moment to publicly recognise Piett's contribution when he raised the fleet readiness concern. A brief "That's a valid point, Admiral" before overruling would have reinforced the behaviour without changing the outcome.
