## Overall Team Health — 2026-01-07

The team is functional but under pressure. [[Death Star II Construction]] delays have created a tension cascade — the Emperor leans on Vader, Vader leans on [[Moff Jerjerrod]], and the stress is visible. [[Admiral Piett]] is performing well but anxious about resource competition between fleet maintenance and DS-II construction. [[General Veers]] remains the steadiest presence — doing his job, delivering results, not seeking attention.

Morale risk: moderate. The extended shifts on DS-II are wearing on engineering crews, and the ripple effects are reaching adjacent teams.

## Individual Updates

### [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] — Station Commander / CEO
- **Current state**: Engaged, politically active
- **Recent observation** (2026-01-03): Dominated the engineering review. Made it clear that DS-II delays reflect on the entire leadership team, not just [[Moff Jerjerrod]]. Subtly positioning himself as the voice of accountability — a move that serves him politically regardless of outcome.
- **Dynamic with Vader**: Mutual respect but watchful. Tarkin defers on military matters but asserts authority on station operations. The balance works as long as neither encroaches on the other's domain.
- **Action needed**: None — maintain the equilibrium.

### [[Admiral Piett]] — VP Naval Operations
- **Current state**: Growing confidence, underlying anxiety
- **Recent observation** (2026-01-03): Spoke up in the engineering review about fleet impact — a positive sign. Previously he would have stayed silent. However, he was visibly nervous when contradicting the resource reallocation.
- **1:1 insight** (2026-01-03): Opened up about workload concerns. Fleet stretched between Rebel pursuit and DS-II support. Needs reassurance that fleet readiness won't be sacrificed. See [[20260103-One-on-One-Admiral-Piett]].
- **Action needed**: Continue encouraging him to voice concerns. Give him explicit cover for fleet maintenance decisions.

### [[General Veers]] — Director of Ground Forces
- **Current state**: Steady, reliable
- **Recent observation** (2026-01-07): Slack thread about ground force readiness — straightforward, no-nonsense update. Troop morale stable, training exercises on schedule. Veers doesn't grandstand or politic — just delivers.
- **Action needed**: Low maintenance. Recognise his reliability explicitly in the next team meeting. He never asks for recognition, which means he deserves it.

### [[Moff Jerjerrod]] — Engineering Lead (DS-II)
- **Current state**: Stressed, defensive
- **Recent observation** (2026-01-03): Presented the DS-II status update with visible tension. Deflected questions about the kyber crystal supply chain. When pressed, blamed procurement rather than acknowledging planning gaps. The excuses are getting thinner.
- **Risk**: Jerjerrod may be hiding the full extent of the delay. His optimism in early reports hasn't been borne out. Need to establish independent verification of his timelines.
- **Action needed**: Schedule direct site visit. Review procurement independently. Consider whether Jerjerrod needs support or replacement — this decision is 4-6 weeks away if things don't improve.

### [[Captain Needa]] — Senior Fleet Captain
- **Current state**: Dutiful, apologetic
- **Recent observation** (2026-01-07): Lost contact with a Rebel probe droid signal in the Anoat sector. His report was characteristically over-apologetic — "I take full responsibility" for what was essentially a sensor glitch. His self-flagellation is disproportionate to the severity of issues.
- **Action needed**: Encourage proportional responses. Needa's fear of failure is making him risk-averse, which is worse than the occasional missed signal.

## Team Relationship Dynamics

### Tarkin ↔ Jerjerrod
Tarkin has limited patience for Jerjerrod's excuses. The engineering review (2026-01-03) was uncomfortable — Tarkin's pointed questions were deliberately designed to expose weakness. Jerjerrod knows Tarkin wants him replaced but can't act without the Emperor's approval.

### Piett ↔ Veers
Healthy working relationship. They coordinate fleet-ground operations smoothly. Veers's steadiness helps balance Piett's anxiety. They appear to have informal check-ins outside formal channels.

### Jerjerrod ↔ Piett
Friction. Piett resents the resource drain of DS-II on fleet maintenance. Jerjerrod views fleet concerns as secondary. This tension needs managing — a direct confrontation would be unproductive.

---

## Emerging Patterns

- **Fear-based performance**: Multiple team members (Piett, Needa, Jerjerrod) show signs of fear-driven behaviour. Piett is managing it constructively; Jerjerrod is hiding behind it; Needa is paralysed by it. Worth considering whether the broader leadership culture (the Emperor's approach) is amplifying this.
- **Information asymmetry**: Jerjerrod may be filtering bad news upward. Need to establish better ground-truth channels on DS-II status.

## Flags

- [ ] **Jerjerrod performance** — 4-6 week decision window on whether he needs support or replacement
- [ ] **Piett development** — Encourage continued growth in assertiveness; don't let resource competition undermine his confidence
- [ ] **Needa risk-aversion** — Needs coaching on proportional responses; fear of failure is becoming operational liability
