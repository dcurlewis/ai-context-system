## [[Emperor Palpatine]]

**Role**: CEO / Supreme Leader
**Relationship**: Boss — demanding, expects results, does not tolerate failure
**Last interaction**: 2026-01-03 (via hologram, engineering review)

### Communication Style
- Prefers: Results-first reporting. No excuses. Demonstrate loyalty through action.
- Avoid: Bringing problems without solutions. Showing hesitation. Mentioning the original Death Star's weakness.

### Current Dynamics
The Emperor is focused on DS-II completion as his strategic priority. He views the timeline as a personal commitment from Vader. Any further delays will shift from professional disappointment to something more... consequential. The relationship is functional as long as results are delivered.

### What He Cares About
- Death Star II operational by his timeline
- Rebel Alliance destroyed
- Loyalty demonstrated through competence, not words
- His vision for galactic order executed without question

### How to Work With Him
- Lead with outcomes, always
- If delivering bad news, pair it with a concrete recovery plan
- Never suggest his strategy is flawed — reframe as "implementation challenges"
- His trust is earned in deeds and maintained by consistency

### Recent History
- 2026-01-03: Attended DS-II engineering review via hologram. Expressed displeasure at delays. Direct quote used as motivation for [[Moff Jerjerrod]].
- 2025-12-20: Approved expanded Outer Rim patrols based on Vader's intelligence briefing.

## [[Grand Moff Tarkin]]

**Role**: Station Commander / CEO
**Relationship**: Peer — mutual respect, occasional friction over priorities
**Last interaction**: 2026-01-03 (engineering review)

### Communication Style
- Prefers: Measured, strategic conversation. Respects directness but values political sophistication.
- Avoid: Being dismissive of station operations. Overstepping into his command authority.

### Current Dynamics
The relationship is stable and productive. Tarkin respects Vader's military authority and connections to the Emperor. Vader respects Tarkin's operational competence and political acumen. Friction emerges when resource allocation requires trade-offs between station operations and fleet/military priorities.

### What He Cares About
- Death Star (both I and II) as the ultimate demonstration of Imperial power
- His personal legacy and political standing
- Operational efficiency and accountability from subordinates
- Maintaining his direct line to the Emperor

### How to Work With Him
- Treat as an equal — he responds poorly to being managed
- Align on shared objectives before meetings where you might disagree
- Give him visibility into fleet operations to maintain trust
- Support his authority in front of subordinates, raise concerns privately

### Recent History
- 2026-01-03: Co-chaired the engineering review. Aligned on the resource reallocation decision. He pushed hard on [[Moff Jerjerrod]] — useful pressure.
- 2025-12-15: Brief discussion about DS-II security protocols. Tarkin deferred to Vader's military assessment.

## [[Admiral Piett]]

**Role**: VP Naval Operations (Direct Report)
**Relationship**: Direct report — competent, growing in confidence, needs support
**Last interaction**: 2026-01-03 (1:1)

### Communication Style
- Prefers: Clear directives with room to execute. Values being heard. Responds well to encouragement.
- Avoid: Public criticism. Putting him on the spot in large meetings without warning. Dismissing his fleet concerns.

### Current Dynamics
Piett is developing into a strong leader. His natural anxiety is channelled productively — it makes him thorough and careful. The 1:1 on 2026-01-03 showed he's willing to raise concerns privately, which is a trust signal. He needs continued encouragement to speak up in larger forums.

### What He Cares About
- Fleet operational readiness — it's his identity and responsibility
- Not disappointing leadership (especially Vader)
- Being seen as competent and reliable
- His crew's wellbeing and morale

### How to Work With Him
- Provide explicit air cover for fleet maintenance decisions when they conflict with DS-II
- Preview meeting topics in advance so he can prepare (reduces anxiety)
- Recognise his contributions publicly — it builds his confidence for bigger moments
- When correcting, do it privately and constructively

### Recent History
- 2026-01-03: 1:1 meeting — opened up about resource concerns. See [[20260103-One-on-One-Admiral-Piett]]
- 2026-01-03: Engineering review — spoke up about fleet impact of resource reallocation. A growth moment.
- 2025-12-28: Briefed on expanded patrol zone. Executed immediately and effectively.

## [[General Veers]]

**Role**: Director of Ground Forces (Direct Report)
**Relationship**: Direct report — reliable, straight-talking, delivers results
**Last interaction**: 2026-01-07 (Slack, fleet ops channel)

### Communication Style
- Prefers: Direct, no-nonsense communication. Respects competence. Dislikes politics.
- Avoid: Political manoeuvring in his presence. Micromanaging his operations.

### Current Dynamics
Veers is the most self-sufficient member of the team. He runs ground forces with minimal oversight and consistent results. The relationship is built on mutual respect and professional trust. Low maintenance, high reliability.

### What He Cares About
- Ground force readiness and capability
- His troops' training and morale
- Clear mission objectives
- Being left to do his job without political interference

### How to Work With Him
- Give clear objectives and get out of his way
- Ask his tactical opinion — it's always grounded and honest
- Recognise his reliability explicitly (he won't ask)
- Use him as a sounding board for operational decisions

### Recent History
- 2026-01-07: Slack update on ground force readiness — all nominal. Professional, concise.
- 2026-01-05: Provided input on Stormtrooper training vendor selection — favoured SienarTech for practical reasons.

## [[Moff Jerjerrod]]

**Role**: Engineering Lead, Death Star II (Project Lead)
**Relationship**: Project lead — under pressure, behind schedule, needs watching
**Last interaction**: 2026-01-03 (engineering review)

### Communication Style
- Prefers: Wants reassurance and resources. Responds to pressure but resents it.
- Avoid: Public humiliation (counterproductive). Taking his optimistic timelines at face value.

### Current Dynamics
Strained. Jerjerrod is under enormous pressure from the DS-II timeline and is managing it poorly — filtering bad news, over-promising recovery timelines, and getting defensive when questioned. The relationship requires active management: enough pressure to drive performance, not so much that he hides problems.

### What He Cares About
- Not being blamed for delays (fear-driven)
- Being seen as capable (insecure)
- Getting more resources (always)
- Surviving this assignment

### How to Work With Him
- Verify his reports independently
- Ask specific, measurable questions ("What percentage is complete?" not "How's it going?")
- Offer support before threats — he responds better to "What do you need?" than "You're failing"
- But make consequences clear if timelines continue to slip

### Recent History
- 2026-01-03: Engineering review — defensive about delays, blamed procurement. See [[20260101-Death-Star-Engineering-Review]]
- 2025-12-15: Requested reduced quality testing — rejected. Took it professionally but visibly frustrated.

## [[Captain Needa]]

**Role**: Senior Fleet Captain (Direct Report)
**Relationship**: Direct report — well-meaning, over-apologetic, needs confidence building
**Last interaction**: 2026-01-07 (incident report)

### Communication Style
- Prefers: Clear expectations. Needs to know mistakes are survivable.
- Avoid: Harsh consequences for minor failures — it amplifies his paralysis.

### Current Dynamics
Needa is competent but hampered by excessive fear of failure. His instinct to "take full responsibility" for everything — even sensor glitches — is both admirable and counterproductive. He needs to develop a more proportional response to setbacks.

### What He Cares About
- Not failing (to an unhealthy degree)
- Honour and duty
- Being seen as reliable

### How to Work With Him
- Distinguish clearly between serious failures and minor setbacks
- When he over-apologises, redirect to solutions
- Give positive reinforcement for good judgment, not just outcomes
- Consider him for a high-visibility assignment where he can succeed — build confidence

## [[Colonel Yularen]]

**Role**: Head of Imperial Security Bureau
**Relationship**: Cross-functional partner — intelligence coordination
**Last interaction**: 2025-12-28 (intelligence briefing)

### Communication Style
- Prefers: Formal, structured briefings. Data-driven.
- Avoid: Casual requests for intelligence. Going around his protocols.

### Current Dynamics
Professional and functional. Yularen provides intelligence; Vader acts on it. The relationship is transactional but reliable. Yularen appreciates Vader's directness and doesn't waste his time with politics.

## [[Dr. Bevel Lemelisk]]

**Role**: Chief Architect
**Relationship**: Technical expert — designed the thermal exhaust port, defensive about it
**Last interaction**: 2026-01-01 (engineering review)

### Communication Style
- Prefers: Technical discussion. Respects engineering arguments. Dislikes being second-guessed by non-engineers.
- Avoid: Directly blaming him for the Death Star I vulnerability. He knows. Everyone knows. Repeating it makes him shut down.

### Current Dynamics
Lemelisk is brilliant but carries the weight of the original Death Star's destruction. Any discussion of design vulnerabilities makes him defensive. The relationship requires handling the technical security review diplomatically — focus on "improvements" not "fixes for your mistakes."

## [[Stormtrooper Commander TK-421]]

**Role**: Training Division Lead
**Relationship**: Programme lead — earnest, operationally focused
**Last interaction**: 2026-01-05 (vendor selection)

### Communication Style
- Prefers: Practical, operational focus. Values being included in decisions that affect his troops.
- Avoid: Joking about Stormtrooper accuracy in his presence. He takes it personally.

### Current Dynamics
TK-421 is personally invested in the training programme succeeding. He sees it as vindication for the Stormtrooper corps. Motivated and reliable, but may need help managing pushback from veteran troopers who resent the implication that their training was inadequate.
