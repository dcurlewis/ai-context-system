## [[Death Star II Construction]]

**Status**: At Risk
**Owner**: [[Moff Jerjerrod]] — Engineering Lead
**Sponsor**: [[Emperor Palpatine]]
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-08

### Current State
Construction is 3 weeks behind the Emperor's timeline. Structural framework for the northern hemisphere is 85% complete, but the superlaser focusing array is stalled due to kyber crystal supply chain issues. [[Moff Jerjerrod]] insists the delays are "temporary" but has said that for the last three status updates.

### Key Decisions
- 2026-01-03: Approved emergency resource reallocation — 2 additional Star Destroyer construction crews reassigned to DS-II
- 2025-12-15: Rejected [[Moff Jerjerrod]]'s request to reduce quality testing on secondary reactor shielding

### Risks & Blockers
- **Kyber crystal supply** — Single source dependency on Jedha mining operations. If supply is disrupted, superlaser timeline extends by 8+ weeks.
- **Emperor's patience** — [[Emperor Palpatine]] expressed displeasure at the last briefing (2026-01-03). Direct quote: "I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am."
- **Workforce fatigue** — Extended shifts on the construction crews. Morale declining per [[General Veers]]'s ground forces report.

### Recent Activity
- 2026-01-08: Reviewed weekly progress report. Superlaser array still blocked.
- 2026-01-03: Engineering review with [[Moff Jerjerrod]] — see [[20260101-Death-Star-Engineering-Review]]
- 2025-12-20: Budget reforecast submitted to Imperial Finance.

### Next Milestones
- Northern hemisphere structural completion — 2026-01-20 (at risk)
- Superlaser array phase 1 installation — 2026-02-15 (blocked)
- Full operational capability — 2026-06-01 (original target, likely to slip)

## [[Stormtrooper Training Programme]]

**Status**: On Track
**Owner**: [[Stormtrooper Commander TK-421]] — Training Division Lead
**Sponsor**: Darth Vader (self)
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-08

### Current State
New training programme launched to address the embarrassing 3.7% blaster accuracy rate. Vendor selected (SienarTech), new simulators being installed across all training facilities. First cohort of troopers begins enhanced training 2026-01-15.

### Key Decisions
- 2026-01-05: Selected SienarTech as training partner — see [[20260105-Stormtrooper-Training-Vendor-Selection]]
- 2025-12-10: Approved budget of 2.4M Imperial credits for simulator procurement

### Risks & Blockers
- **Simulator delivery** — 3 of 12 training pods arrived damaged. Replacements in transit, expected 2026-01-12.
- **Trooper resistance** — Some veteran stormtroopers view new training as criticism. [[Stormtrooper Commander TK-421]] managing messaging.

### Recent Activity
- 2026-01-08: 9 of 12 training pods operational. First cohort roster finalised.
- 2026-01-05: Vendor selection completed after 3-week evaluation. SienarTech won on accuracy improvement guarantees.

### Next Milestones
- First cohort training begins — 2026-01-15
- 30-day accuracy assessment — 2026-02-15
- Target: 15% accuracy rate by Q3 2026

## [[Fleet Readiness — Rebel Pursuit]]

**Status**: Active
**Owner**: [[Admiral Piett]] — VP Naval Operations
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-07

### Current State
Intelligence suggests increased Rebel activity in the Outer Rim. Fleet is at 87% operational readiness — 3 Star Destroyers in maintenance cycle, expected back by 2026-01-20. [[Admiral Piett]] coordinating patrol routes with [[Colonel Yularen]]'s intelligence reports.

### Key Decisions
- 2025-12-28: Approved expanded patrol zone to cover Hoth sector based on probe droid data
- 2025-12-15: Rejected proposal to reduce fleet maintenance cycle (too risky)

### Risks & Blockers
- **Intelligence gaps** — Rebel base location still unconfirmed despite probe droid deployment
- **Maintenance backlog** — Pushing maintenance to chase Rebels would reduce long-term readiness

### Recent Activity
- 2026-01-07: [[Admiral Piett]] briefed on latest probe droid findings. Several promising leads in Hoth system.
- 2025-12-28: Patrol routes updated. Additional TIE fighter squadrons deployed to Outer Rim sectors.

### Next Milestones
- 3 Star Destroyers return from maintenance — 2026-01-20
- Rebel base confirmation — TBD (intelligence-dependent)
- Fleet readiness target: 95% by 2026-02-01
