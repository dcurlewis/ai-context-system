## Processing Priorities

1. **Decisions and rationale** — The most valuable long-term memory. Every significant decision with context, alternatives, and who was involved.
2. **Relationship dynamics** — How key people think, communicate, and what they care about. This context makes every interaction more effective.
3. **Project risks and blockers** — Early warning signals and their resolution (or escalation).
4. **Commitments and action items** — Who promised what and when.
5. **Strategic shifts** — Changes in direction, priority, or organisational focus.
