## 2026-01-05 — Stormtrooper Training Vendor Selection

**Decision**: Selected SienarTech as the training and simulation partner for the Stormtrooper accuracy improvement programme.

**Context**: Blaster accuracy across all Stormtrooper divisions sits at 3.7% — an operational embarrassment. Three vendors were evaluated over a 3-week period to provide simulation-based training systems.

**Alternatives Considered**:
| Vendor | Proposal | Strength | Weakness |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| SienarTech | Full simulation suite, 12 training pods, 6-month programme | Best accuracy improvement guarantees (15% target), existing Imperial relationship | Most expensive (2.4M credits) |
| BlasTech Industries | Weapons modification + basic training | Lower cost (1.1M credits), faster deployment | Addressed equipment, not skill — limited improvement potential |
| Kuat Systems Engineering | VR-based training programme | Innovative approach, scalable | Unproven technology, no accuracy guarantees |

**Decided By**: Darth Vader, with input from [[Stormtrooper Commander TK-421]] and [[General Veers]]

**Rationale**: SienarTech offered the only contractual accuracy improvement guarantee. The cost premium is justified by the reputational and operational cost of current accuracy rates. BlasTech's approach was too narrow, and Kuat's technology was unproven at Imperial scale.

**Impact**: 2.4M Imperial credits committed. 12 training pods being installed. First cohort begins 2026-01-15.

**Revisit**: 30-day assessment on 2026-02-15. If accuracy hasn't improved to at least 8%, escalate to renegotiate terms.

## 2026-01-03 — Emergency Resource Reallocation to Death Star II

**Decision**: Reassign 2 Star Destroyer construction crews to [[Death Star II Construction]] to accelerate the timeline.

**Context**: Construction is 3 weeks behind the Emperor's schedule. [[Moff Jerjerrod]] requested additional resources at the engineering review. [[Emperor Palpatine]] has made his expectations clear.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Do nothing** — Unacceptable given the Emperor's expectations.
- **Hire civilian contractors** — Security risk for a military installation of this classification.
- **Reduce scope** — Not possible without the Emperor's approval (which would not be forthcoming).

**Decided By**: Darth Vader, ratified by [[Grand Moff Tarkin]]

**Rationale**: The two construction crews from Star Destroyer maintenance can be spared for 6 weeks without impacting fleet readiness below acceptable levels. This buys time while the kyber crystal supply issue is resolved.

**Impact**: Fleet maintenance cycle extended by 2 weeks. [[Admiral Piett]] notified — he's not happy but understands the priority.

**Revisit**: 2026-01-17 — assess whether the reallocation has closed the schedule gap.

## 2025-12-28 — Expanded Outer Rim Patrol Zone

**Decision**: Expand fleet patrol zone to include the Hoth sector based on probe droid intelligence.

**Context**: Probe droids deployed to 50+ systems have returned data suggesting Rebel activity concentration in the Hoth system and surrounding sectors.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Focused strike** — Insufficient intelligence for a targeted assault. Risk of alerting Rebels.
- **Maintain current patrols** — Would miss the window if Rebels relocate.

**Decided By**: Darth Vader, with intelligence briefing from [[Colonel Yularen]]

**Rationale**: Expanding the patrol zone is low-risk and maintains pressure. If the Hoth lead confirms, we'll have assets already in position.

**Impact**: 4 additional TIE fighter squadrons deployed. Fuel costs up 12% for Outer Rim fleet operations.

## 2025-12-15 — Rejected Reduced Quality Testing for DS-II Reactor Shielding

**Decision**: Rejected [[Moff Jerjerrod]]'s request to reduce quality testing phases on Death Star II secondary reactor shielding from 3 stages to 1.

**Context**: [[Moff Jerjerrod]] proposed cutting testing to save 2 weeks on the construction timeline. The request came after pressure from the Emperor's office.

**Decided By**: Darth Vader

**Rationale**: The original Death Star's destruction demonstrated what happens when engineering shortcuts are taken. Secondary reactor shielding protects against cascading failures. Two weeks of schedule improvement is not worth the risk of catastrophic failure. The Emperor values a battle station that works over one that's finished a fortnight early.

**Impact**: Timeline remains 3 weeks behind. [[Moff Jerjerrod]] was not pleased but accepted the decision.
