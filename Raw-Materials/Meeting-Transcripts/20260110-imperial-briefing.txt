[Recording begins]

VADER: Let's begin. I want status updates from each division. Admiral Piett, fleet readiness first.

PIETT: Yes, my lord. Fleet readiness stands at 84%, up from 82% last week. We've recalled the Avenger from Outer Rim patrol as contingency, which brings us above the 80% threshold. The three Star Destroyers in extended maintenance are on track to return by the 20th. Patrol coverage in the Hoth sector continues as planned.

VADER: And the Hoth intelligence?

PIETT: The probe droid data is... promising, my lord. Energy readings from the sixth planet are consistent with a power generator capable of sustaining a medium-sized installation. Colonel Yularen's team has corroborated with signals intelligence.

YULAREN: That's correct. We've intercepted coded transmissions originating from the Hoth system over the past 72 hours. The encryption matches known Rebel communication protocols. I'd classify this as a high-confidence lead, though not yet confirmed.

TARKIN: How long until we can confirm?

YULAREN: We need to deploy a long-range sensor probe to the planet's surface. I've requested one from the 4th Sector Fleet. Estimated arrival in the Hoth system: three to five days.

VADER: I sense something. The Rebel Alliance is there. Accelerate the timeline, Colonel.

YULAREN: Understood, Lord Vader. I'll reprioritise the probe deployment.

TARKIN: If the Rebels are indeed on Hoth, we should begin planning an assault. General Veers, what's the ground force readiness for a cold-weather operation?

VEERS: We're ready, sir. Cold-weather gear was requisitioned last week and is being distributed to the 501st and Blizzard Force. AT-AT walkers are serviced and operational. I can have a ground assault force assembled within 48 hours of a go-decision.

TARKIN: Impressive efficiency, General.

VEERS: Just doing the job, sir.

VADER: Moff Jerjerrod. Death Star II status.

JERJERROD: Lord Vader, I'm pleased to report that construction has accelerated since the crew reallocation. The northern hemisphere structural framework reached 88% completion yesterday, ahead of the revised schedule.

TARKIN: And the superlaser array?

JERJERROD: The... the kyber crystal shipment arrived on the 8th. Unfortunately, the delivery was only 60% of our requested allocation. We've adjusted the installation sequence to prioritise the primary focusing chamber, but the secondary arrays will be delayed.

VADER: 60%. You reported the shipment as "confirmed" in your daily update on the 7th. You failed to mention the shortfall.

JERJERROD: My lord, I... I didn't want to raise concerns until I had assessed the full impact. I was going to include it in this week's—

VADER: You will report all material information as it becomes available. Not when it suits your narrative. Is that clear?

JERJERROD: Perfectly clear, my lord. I apologise. The revised timeline for the superlaser array is— 

VADER: I'll receive a written report by end of day. With accurate figures. Continue.

JERJERROD: Yes, my lord. On the positive side, the secondary reactor shielding passed phase 2 quality testing. Phase 3 begins next week. And the crew morale has improved since we implemented the rotation schedule General Veers suggested.

VADER: General Veers, the Stormtrooper training programme update.

VEERS: SienarTech has 10 of 12 training pods operational. The remaining two replacement units arrive tomorrow. First training cohort began on the 8th — two days ahead of schedule, thanks to Commander TK-421's initiative. Early feedback from the troopers is positive. They're calling the new simulators "the gauntlet." Accuracy data from the first sessions shows a baseline improvement of 1.2% already, and that's before the AI-driven personalised programmes kick in.

VADER: Acceptable. Continue tracking weekly.

VEERS: Yes, my lord.

TARKIN: One additional item. The Emperor has requested a comprehensive readiness report covering all Death Star operations — both stations — by the end of the month. He wants fleet status, construction progress, and defence capabilities in a single document. Lord Vader, I suggest we co-author this.

VADER: Agreed. We'll coordinate. Admiral Piett, you'll provide fleet data. Jerjerrod, construction figures. Accurate ones.

JERJERROD: Yes, my lord.

PIETT: Of course, my lord.

TARKIN: Colonel Yularen, one more thing. Has Imperial Security seen any indication that the Rebels are aware of the Death Star II construction?

YULAREN: No credible intelligence suggests they are, Governor Tarkin. We've maintained information compartmentalisation effectively. However, the increased supply shipments to the Endor system could eventually draw attention. I recommend reviewing our logistics routing.

TARKIN: Sensible. Add it to your security review.

VADER: Anything else? 

[Silence]

VADER: Then we're done. Dismissed. Jerjerrod, your report. End of day.

JERJERROD: Yes, my lord.
