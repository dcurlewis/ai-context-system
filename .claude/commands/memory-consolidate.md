description: Review and consolidate memory updates (Phase 3 of 5)
---

Complete the memory update process following Phase 3 in `Guidelines/memory-consolidation-guidelines.md`.

## Prerequisites — MUST CHECK FIRST

Before proceeding, verify ALL six memory files exist in today's staging directory:

```
Memory/YYYYMMDD-memory-update/
├── memory-organization.md
├── memory-strategy.md
├── memory-projects.md
├── memory-decisions.md
├── memory-team-dynamics.md
└── memory-relationships.md
```

**If any file is missing, STOP and inform the user which file(s) are missing.** Do not proceed with consolidation until all six files exist.

## Process

1. List staging directory contents to verify all six files present
2. If any missing: Report which files are missing and stop
3. If all present: Review all updated files for guideline adherence
4. Check especially for:
   - Professional tone throughout
   - Factual documentation standards
   - Proper status markers
   - No duplication across files
5. Update `Memory/memory-index.md` with:
   - New "Last Updated" date
   - Summary of key changes
   - Any critical context updates

## Quality Checks

Verify:
- All assessments are sourced
- No dramatic language exists outside quotes
- All content is factual not opinion-based
- Status markers are current and accurate

## Output

1. Update `Memory/memory-index.md`
2. Inform user to run `/memory-validate` next
